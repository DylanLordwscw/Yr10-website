        <br>
        <li>Ambury park has a good selection of loops, however there are no super challenging trails.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Hunua ranges, Hunua is a super fun place to ride but dont go here when its muddy as it is in dense bush.</li>

    <li>Maraetai / Whitford This is and excellent bike park with over 50km + of trails <br> on offer for all skill levels.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Duders Park, this place does not have any technical trails but is rather a <br> simple loop around the park.</li>
    <br>
    <li>440 Mtb park, this is arguably the best place to ride in the whole of auckland <br> as it provides a shuttle service to the top for fast paced adrenaline <br> filled rides to the bottom. Important note: not for beginners.</li>
    <br>
</ul>
    <h2>North Harbour</h2>
<h3>3.&nbsp;&nbsp; Across the bridge you will find quite a few trails including another contestant for Aucklands best trail network, Woodhill.</h3>

    <li>Woodhill contains many many trails of all variety, all ontop of a fun dry sandy <br> base that is rideable all year round.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Aswell as riverhead forest, this is not a area for beginenrs as its extremely <br> easy to get lost and you will be sharing the park with dirt bikers.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Ontop of these two excellence places to ride there is birkenhead dirt jumps which <br> have a good few jumps however there is a no dig no ride rule here, <br> which unexperienced jumpers will have to learn about.</li>
    <br> 
    <li>Sanders reserve, located just by paremoremo has many trails on offer and is a <br> fun place to go for a few hours.</li>
    <br>
</ul>
    <h2>West Auckland</h2>
<h3>4.&nbsp;&nbsp; Over to the west there is one trail on offer, the beverage track.</h3>
<ul> 
    <li>The beverage track is a very easy cross country trail that starts just outside <br> of  sunnyvale.</li>
    <br>
</ul>
    <h2>Central Auckland</h2>
<h3>5.&nbsp;&nbsp; There isnt much here in the central city, as you woukld expect in a dense area.</h3>
<ul>
    <li>however there is Arch Hill, this is home to a variety of tight windy cross <br> country / tech trails. </li>
    <br>
    <li>On top of that a short ferry ride across the harbour can get you to waiheke island <br> bike trails these have many, many, trails and you can spend a full <br> day here without riding all the trails.</li>
