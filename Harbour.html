<h3>3.&nbsp;&nbsp; Across the bridge you will find quite a few trails including another contestant for Aucklands best trail network, Woodhill.</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Woodhill contains many many trails of all variety, all ontop of a fun dry sandy <br> base that is rideable all year round. It also has bikes for rent <br>and trails for all skill levels.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Riverhead Forest, this is not a area for beginenrs as its extremely <br> easy to get lost. Another note is that you will be sharing the park with dirt <br>bikers.</li>
