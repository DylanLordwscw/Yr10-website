    <h2>Central Auckland</h2>
<h3>5.&nbsp;&nbsp; There isnt much here in the central city, as you woukld expect in a dense area.</h3>
<ul>
    <li>however there is Arch Hill, this is home to a variety of tight windy cross <br> country / tech trails. </li>
    <br>
    <li>On top of that a short ferry ride across the harbour can get you to waiheke island <br> bike trails these have many, many, trails and you can spend a full <br> day here without riding all the trails.</li>
